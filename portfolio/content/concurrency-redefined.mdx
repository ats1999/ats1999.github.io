title: "Concurrency Redefined"
publishedAt: "2025-05-09"
summary: "At first glance, it may seem that two operations are concurrent if they occur at the same time on different systems or processes. However, in distributed systems, concurrency shouldnâ€™t be defined by time. Two operations can be considered concurrent even if they occur at different times, as long as both operations are not aware of each other."

It is because of the problem with clocks in distributed systems, it is quite difficult to tell weather two operation occurred at the same time.
