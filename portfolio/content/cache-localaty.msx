title: "Building Consistent Audit Log System with Change Data Capture (CDC)"
publishedAt: "2025-02-05"
summary: "Capturing reliable and consistent audit logs is essential for traceability, compliance, and debugging. This blog explores how to build a consistent audit logging system using Change Data Capture (CDC). Weâ€™ll cover the core concepts of CDC, how it enables reliable tracking of database changes, and practical implementation tips to ensure your logs are complete, ordered, and tamper-resistant."
