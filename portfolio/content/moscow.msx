title: "Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), Change Data Capture (CDC) & PostgreSQL"
publishedAt: "2025-04-24"
summary: "In this article, we dive into the core concepts of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and Change Data Capture (CDC) â€” two critical mechanisms for ensuring data durability, consistency, and real-time data streaming. We explain how WAL provides fault tolerance in databases by recording changes before applying them, and how CDC enables capturing and propagating data changes across systems in near real-time. This post also outlines industry best practices for implementing WAL and CDC in PostgreSQL"
