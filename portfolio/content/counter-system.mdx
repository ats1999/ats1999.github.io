title: "A simple group scoped counter system (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/MySql)"
publishedAt: "2024-06-18"
summary: "Id of every new task in JIRA board starts with 1 and increments by 1 for each new task. There isn‚Äôt any database that supports group scoped auto increment. Let's explore some solutions in this blog."

## Using auto increment (MySql/PostgreSQL)

- Counters are scoped to table
- We can not use different counter for different group

## Using sequence in PostgreSQL

- They are database level objects, so every group we can create new sequence
- PostgreSQL sequence is large in size when compared to counter. Every PostgreSQL sequence object takes around ~8KB.

## Using counter table (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

We can use counter table to solve above problems.

- Counter table is simple to build and use
- It is storage efficient, it takes only few bytes per counter as compared to ~8KB in PostgreSQL sequence
- It works for group scoped counter, for every group a new row can be inserted

```txt
    Column     |            Type             | Collation | Nullable | Default
---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 name          | character varying(255)      |           | not null |
 value         | bigint                      |           | not null |
```

> Query to update the counter and return updated value in one round trip

```sql
UPDATE counter
SET
  value = value+1
WHERE
  name = :counterName
RETURNING value
```

> **Note**: In MongoDB, you can use a dedicated document for each counter similar to dedicated row in PostgreSQL/MySql

## Scaling Challanges

> You must be a very big company(like google, microsoft) before you hit the limit.

Scaling above counter system very simple, let's start from zero and scale it to handle large number of requests.

### Scaling: Counter table in the same database

If you are not an enterprice or huge tech gaint(google/amazon), you can start with keeping the counter table along with other tables in database.

### Scaling: Moving counter table to a dedicated database

If you hit the limit, and counter table is frequently used. You can move counter table to a dedicated database. It'll allows you to scale up/down your counter service as per your need. For most of the companies, vertical scaling should be enough.

### Scaling: Using sharding

If you hit the limit of vertical scale, you can use sharding. Keep different counters on different databases. This way, you'll be able to achieve ultimate scale.

### Scaling: beyond sharding

Congratulations üëè

## Summary

A lightweight, scalable, and durable group-scoped counter system can be built using a simple counter table or document in PostgreSQL/MongoDB, avoiding the limitations of auto-increment and heavy database sequences.
